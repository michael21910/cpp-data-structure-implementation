# CPP Data Structure Implementation
There are lots of data structures in this repo.  
  
## Small story :speech_balloon:
I decided to improve myself bt implementing data structures!  
It's a bg challenge for me, but I will try to do my best!  
  
## What are these :question:
The data structure implementation files including these member functions:
* [node.hpp](node.hpp)
    * getData
        * gets the data of the node
    * setData
        * sets the data of the node
    * getNext
        * gets the next node of the current node
    * setNext
        * sets the next node of the current node
    * getPrev
        * gets the previous node of the current node
    * setPrev
        * sets the previous node of the current node
* [linkedlist.hpp](linkedlist.hpp)
    * insert
        * inserts a node to the nth position of the linked list with the data
    * insertFromHead
        * inserts a node to the head of the linked list with the data
    * insertFromTail
        * inserts a node to the tail of the linked list with the data
    * remove
        * removes a node at the nth position of the linked list
    * removeFromHead
        * removes a node at the head of the linked list
    * removeFromTail
        * removes a node at the tail of the linked list
    * reverse
        * reverses the linked list
    * print
        * prints out the data of the linked list in order
    * printReverse
        * prints out the data of the linked list in reverse order without reversing the linked list
    * getHead
        * get the head of the linked list
    * getSize
        * get the size of the linked list
    * setSize
        * set the size of the linked list
* [stack.h](stack.hpp)
    * push
        * push an element into the stack
    * pop
        * pop an element out of the stack
    * top
        * return the data of the first element in the stack
    * isEmpty
        * return 0 or 1 if the stack is empty
    * print
        * print the stack
    * getSize
        * get the size of the stack
    * setSize
        * set the size of the stack
* [main.cpp](main.cpp)
    * including the testing codes
* TBC...
  
## Things you need to do :open_book:

```
* run main.cpp in your own PC
* check out the results!
